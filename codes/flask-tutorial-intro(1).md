- RESTful request dispatching
- Jinja2 templating
- Support for secure cookies (client-side sessions)
- 100% WSGI 1.0 compliant
- Unicode-based
- Extensive documentation
- Google App Engine compatibility
- Extensions available to add application features

## 2. Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Installing Python
1. Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the latest version of Python for your operating system
3. Run the installer and follow the installation wizard
4. Verify the installation by opening a terminal and typing: `python --version`

### Creating a Virtual Environment
1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

### Installing Flask
With your virtual environment activated, install Flask using pip:

```
pip install flask
```

To verify the installation, run:

```
python -c "import flask; print(flask.__version__)"
```

This should print the installed Flask version.
